<H2>The scriptol programming language was designed with seven rules in mind.</H2>


Ren√© Descartes. I think therefore I am. I program, therefore you exist.
<H2>Rule 1</h2>: Program as you think
 The syntax of the language matches the way a human thinks, and objects of the human conceptions are formalized in the simplest way.  The language will have a vocal port.

<H2>Rule 2</h2>: Safety
 The language reduces risk of errors by the programmer. It has a clear, simple, minimal, and not confusing syntax. Any cause of error is removed from the language.

<H2>Rule 3</h2>: Common conventions
 When the 1 and 2 rules are not sufficient to define the language, this one is applied.
 The language keeps what is familiar to programmers. The main reference languages are C++, PHP, HTML.

<H2>Rule 4</h2>: Objectivity
 No any element of the language is arbitrary choosen. Each one is determined by the seven rules and is the best choice.

<H2>Rule 5</h2>: No limited orientation
 The language design is not oriented towards an unique trend, as objects for example. It is built also with goals, events, procedures, rules, patterns.
 The language has objects and actions. Any statement is also writable as an event. Objects are dynamic. Actions may be acquired as data.

<H2>Rule 6</h2>: Portability
 The language will run on any OS or computer. The language is not compiled directly into native code. It is currently compiled to Php or C++, MSIL for .net.

<H2>Rule 7</h2>: Easy learning
 For easy learning, the tutorial has two levels. The common level of the language covers the features of classical scripting. The total language will goes far beyond.
 For easy learning also, the programmer may write keywords in any human language.
